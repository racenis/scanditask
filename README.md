# Take-home assignment for Scandiweb

After 2 months I finally got a response:
"Unfortunately, after thorough consideration, we have concluded that your current skills and knowledge do not match our current expectations for a Junior Web Developer position thus we will discontinue your candidacy."

I asked them to elaborate. 3 months have passed since then. I have not received a reply.

## Deployment

Set up a MySQL server. Create a database. The `/db_init.sql` file contains SQL
queries which will set up the tables for the database.

Edit the `/config.php` file and enter the connection information for the 
database.

Copy in all of the files in the repository into the server.
